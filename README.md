# To-Do-List
I made this project initially in the console. After getting familiar with creating GUIs, I recreated it with Tkinter to make it more user-friendly. 

New skills I learned through this project were how to:
- Scrollbars
- Pop up message boxes
- Listbox

This program allows you to create a To-Do list where you can add tasks you input, list the importance, and scroll through a variety of tasks

Keyboard Shortcuts:
Enter (on keyboard) to add a task
Delete (on keyboard) to mark a task as complete
