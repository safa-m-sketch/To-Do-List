# To-Do-List
I decided to alter this project a year later after learning how to create a GUI

This project previously started as only outputting in the console. After using skills learned from following the Calculator tutorial I created a to do list with Tkinter as well. I added similar properties such as hovering and connecting to keyboard.
New skills I learned through this project was how to add a scroll, dropdown, message box, and got familar with using listbox.

This program allows you to create a To-Do list where you can add tasks you input, list the importance, scroll through (if you have a LONGGG list)

Keyboard Shortcuts:
Enter (on keyboard) to add a task
Delete (on keyboard) to mark a task as complete
